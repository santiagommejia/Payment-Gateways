# Payment Gateways

 This is an Angular project that contains templates for the integration to the following payment gateways:
 
 - BNB (Banco Nacional de Bolivia) dynamic QR generation.
 - Cybersource (Silent Post)
 - Lib√©lula
 - Khipu

Note: These methods wont work if run on a local server, they need to be deployed into a web page in order to pass the CORS preflight request due to security reasons, as well as be properly implemented into your business logic.

## Development server

Run `npm start` for a dev server.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
