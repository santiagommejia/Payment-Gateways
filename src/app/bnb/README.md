# BNB integration

To integrate the BNB dynamic QR system you have to personally contact the BNB Bank in Bolivia and sign the contract for the use of their API. Once this is done they will provide you the `api endpoint`, `accountId` and `authorizationId` you need to replace in the `environment` files. This template contains the implementation of the flows described in their integration manual.

Note: This implementation is dated according to the 2019 API integration manual, read their documentation carefully for changes that might not be included in this template.
